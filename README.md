# metricsC
metricsC is a project that includes building blocks and functions for estimating econometric models in C. Most of the procedures are void functions callable in software including R in order to speed up computations. To a large extent possible, we provide test (main) programmes for complete C implementation.

The folders organise the programmes into categories/models. The _test.c files contain programmes for implementing the models in C. Also, each  _test.c file contains gcc terminal commands (as comments) for compiling and executing the programmes. For different compilers, a little adaption of the commands may be required.
